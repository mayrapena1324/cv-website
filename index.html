        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am currently working through Dr. Angela Yu's 100 days of code Bootcamp to build my coding skills!
            As a transitioning teacher, my current focus is on sharpening the skills I will be utilizing
            in my next professional chapter. I was searching for something that was going to bring challenge and
            meaning to my life; coding provides me with that! I am thrilled to learn skills that will allow me to build
            and collaborate on projects, and I aspire to be a leader in this field. I am confident, that with hard work
            and dedication, I will lead teams and be a mentor to others.</p>
            <p class="intro">
            I love sharing knowledge with people in fun and engaging ways while making connections with people and helping them reach their goals. My time as an
            Orchestra Director has shown me that people will flourish the most when you cultivate a positive rapport
            and provide authentic connection. I know this is something I can bring with me on my new journey, and
            it will provide value to my next position.</p>
